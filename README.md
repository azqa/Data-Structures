# Data-Structures

## Linked List (Singly and Circular)
- This project combined the singly and circular linked lists to achieve the airplane fuel system application.
- Unit tests were created to test out the functionality of the program thoroughly.

## BST
- Implemented a balanced binary search tree (BST) data structure and wrote rebalancing routines using recursion.
- Unit tests were created to test out the functionality of the program thoroughly.

## Heaps (Leftist and Skew)
- constructed a heap data structure as a priority queue ADT
- Practiced writing merge operations in skew and leftist heap data structures using recursion
- Unit tests were created to test out the functionality of the program thoroughly.

## Hash Tables (Quadratic and Double-hash probing)
- Implemented quadratic and double-hash probing to manage hash collisions and an incremental re-hashing algorithm.
- Unit tests were created to test out the functionality of the program thoroughly.
