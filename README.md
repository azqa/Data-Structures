# Data-Structures

##Linked List
- This project combined the use of singly and circular linked list to acheive the airplane fuel system application.
- Unit tests were created to thorougly test out the functionlity of the program.

##BST
- Implemented a balanced binary search tree (BST) data structure as well as wrote rebalancing routines using recusrion.
- Unit tests were created to thorougly test out the functionlity of the program.

##Heaps (Leftist and Skew)
- construced a heap data structure as a priority queue ADT
- Practiced writing merge operation in skew and leftist heap data structures uaing recursion
- Unit tests were created to thorougly test out the functionlity of the program.

##Hash Tables (quadratic and double-hash probing)
- Implemented quadratic and double-hash probing to manage hash collisions and a incremental re-hashing algorithm.
- Unit tests were created to thorougly test out the functionlity of the program.
